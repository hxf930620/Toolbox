# Toolbox
Some handy (matlab or python) tools.

## TODO

- [x] Add a python tool (for [Caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/) model) to merge statistic (*i.e.* mean, variance, scale and shift) of BN Layers to Conv Layers for faster inference during TESTING phase.
- [ ] Add a python tool to prune well-trained model for faster inference with less GPU memory usage.
- [ ] Add a python tool to convert a pretrained pytorch model to use in inference in Caffe.
